 * This runner is used from gradle build and avoids creating runner classes manually

 * Caution: The cucumber.json generated from this runner is ONLY useful when the build is complete
 * Any use of this cucumber.json while the build is running OR it is aborted - will lead to wrong reports
 * The report is claimed to be threadsafe but the disk version is unusable until the build is complete
